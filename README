Build and Run Locally
You can simulate the app by running it locally using the local utility of Chalice:

(env)$ chalice local

Deploy on AWS Lambda
Chalice makes deploying your serverless app completely effortless. Using the deploy utility, you can simply instruct Chalice to deploy and create a Lambda function that can be accessible via a REST API.

Before we begin deployment, we need to make sure we have our AWS credentials in place, usually located at ~/.aws/config. The contents of the file look as follows:

[default]
aws_access_key_id=<your-access-key-id>
aws_secret_access_key=<your-secret-access-key>
region=<your-region>
With AWS credentials in place, letâ€™s begin our deployment process with just a single command:

(env)$ chalice deploy
